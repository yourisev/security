# Authentication API
Created a simple authentication API to understand the flow of this process and test on Postman.

The image below shows an attempt to use the authenticate endpoint of our endpoint with a non existing user,
notice the 403 code.
![Auth-Failed](https://github.com/yourisev/security/assets/69630866/f162a65c-4562-42b5-8fc0-4f62f189e19b)

Just to show the previous image is right we can see that our Postgres DB is empty on the image below.

The image below shows that the user with credentials in the body of the request is successfullly registered,
notice the 200 code.

The image below shows how the DB is populated after we sent the above request to registration endpoint.

We then authenticate using the credentials registered previously and notice the request is succesful and
we are given a token just as it was the case with the registration process and a code of 200 is generated.

We then try to access a secured end point using a token that was not generated by the system and we equally have a 403
code.
![Bad-token-test](https://github.com/yourisev/security/assets/69630866/f17d9ff7-585e-413b-819f-769184217567)

We finally pass a non expired token generated when trying to register above an we notice this access is successful with
a 200 code.

## Description

A User class is created and lombok is used to inject boiler plate code for getters/setters, contructors and is made to use the builder pattern. This class is equally made to be an Entity and an Id is added as attribute to the class and given a table name. Further this class is made to implement the [UserDetails Interface ](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/UserDetails.html). The **_user** table is created on the fly each time the app is started (This is configured in the properties file with __create-drop__ value). A UserRepository is created and a method findByEmail is added to retrieve users in the DB using their emails. We equally created an Enum Role for the different user roles anticipated.

Two Rest Controllers were created and one is assigned to an endpoint that could only be accessed if there is a valid authorization token present in the request __DemoController__. On the other side, __AuthenticationController__ has two methods that each take in a RegisterRequest and an AuthenticationRequest and both return an AuthenticationResponse. The return type of the both methods in the previously mentioned controller were defined for this project also their request body. A model was again created to match the potential view for the registration end point. We then had to configure the application and its security to make sure the different endpoints have their required level of security and also encryped the passwords.
